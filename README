some UEFI programming experiments using the GNU-EFI framework.

experiments:
    - a program for getting the system's memory map
    - a test for writing on screen's framebuffer

requisites:
    - gnu-efi (for using UEFI headers with gcc)
    - objcopy (for converting ELF executables to PE32+)
    - mtools
    - qemu-system-x86_64
    - a UEFI firmware image for booting up (OVMF recommended)

using the Makefile:
    you need to setup the first macros in order to compile the experiments.
    you may change the default image for 'make run' on the Makefile. otherwise 
    you can use 'make run TARGET=img/<target>.img'.

booting the image:
    you can burn the .img files into a USB drive using your favourite tool and
    boot up the UEFI images on real hardware.
    use at your own risk; i'm not responsible for any hardware damage.
